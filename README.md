This ReactJS application Student Connect allows students to add/edit/delete student profiles

It is also possible to interact with the student profile by liking the profile

All the student profiles are rendered in a TackStack table with ShadCN

I chose TackStack-ShadCN because it is lightweight compared to AG-Grid and MUI - it doesn't load dependencies that are unnecessary
- It also has in-built sorting and filtering mechanisms

I used generative AI to help me 
- integrate the TackStack-ShadCN library with my react application
- implement the delete functionality
- to optimize the code
